# Snake Game

A classic Snake game built with Python using the `pygame` library. Control the snake, collect food, and try to achieve the highest score while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following is installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.8 or higher)
- `pip` (Python package installer)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Snake game on your local system:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd snake-game
   ```

3. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate       # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate          # On Windows
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Game

1. Start the game by running the main Python script:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```

2. The game window will open. Use the arrow keys to control the snake.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move the snake (Up, Down, Left, Right)
- **Escape (ESC)**: Quit the game

## Game Features

- **Dynamic Gameplay**: The snake grows with each food item collected.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the current score in real-time.
- **Game Over Screen**: Informs you of your final score with the option to restart.

## Building from Source

To package the game into an executable:

1. Install `pyinstaller`:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Create an executable:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile snake_game.py
   ```

3. The executable will be located in the `dist/` directory.
